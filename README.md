# Active-learning
Active Learning is a type of machine learning approach that involves the machine learning model selecting the most informative and relevant data points from an unlabeled dataset for human annotation or labeling. In Active Learning, the machine learning model iteratively selects a subset of the data that it believes is the most useful for improving its accuracy and requests a human expert to label those data points. The labeled data is then added to the training dataset, and the machine learning model is retrained using the updated dataset. This iterative process continues until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. Active Learning can help reduce the amount of data needed for training a machine learning model, making it more efficient and effective.
