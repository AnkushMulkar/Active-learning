# Active-learning
Active Learning is a type of machine learning approach that involves the machine learning model selecting the most informative and relevant data points from an unlabeled dataset for human annotation or labeling. In Active Learning, the machine learning model iteratively selects a subset of the data that it believes is the most useful for improving its accuracy and requests a human expert to label those data points. The labeled data is then added to the training dataset, and the machine learning model is retrained using the updated dataset. This iterative process continues until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. Active Learning can help reduce the amount of data needed for training a machine learning model, making it more efficient and effective.

Example to understand more about Active learning,

Let's say you are building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a banking system. The model needs to be trained on a large dataset of transactions, with each transaction labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. However, labeling all the data manually is time-consuming and expensive.

This is where Active Learning comes in. The machine learning model selects a subset of the data that it believes is the most informative and useful for training. Then, a Human-in-the-Loop Labeling process is embedded in the loop, where a human reviews and improves the labels for the selected transactions.

By doing this, the machine learning model can be trained on a smaller, yet more accurate dataset, which improves its performance in detecting fraudulent transactions. This approach saves time and money while still ensuring the quality of the data used to train the model.
